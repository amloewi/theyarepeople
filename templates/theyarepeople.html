            <h4>Dear member of this nation's media,</h4>

            I recently read some of your work on Donald Trump. Unfortunately, I
            believe you left out the aspect of this man that most deserves
            national attention.

            <br>
            <h4>"These are not people. Just remember that."</h5>

            Donald Trump said that, to a vast crowd, at a rally in North Carolina.
            Talking about people who disagreed with his deep belief -- that
            there is humanity that can be dismissed. That he can snarl it away,
            while those around him nod soberly, encouraged.

            <br>
            <h4>If there is one thing that makes me human,<br> it is that I see others as human.</h4>

            And I will not entertain the threat of a president who does not
            enshrine this principle. And I will not sit while he is written and
            talked or even joked about, in a way that allows one to ignore this
            side of him. So I plead with you now to use your post, and its power,
            to describe the man as he is.


            <!-- <h4>Let this be where it ends.</h4>
            <br>
            It doesn't even matter who he's talking about, because no matter who
            they are, they are people. If there is one truth that matters, it
            is this one. And he snarls it away, to people who nod, believing.
            <br><br>
            Any article about Donald Trump, that's talking about his electability,
            or his strange appeal, or even his clownishness -- send the journalist here. Any
            show, that focusses on any aspect of him that isn't this one -- send
            the anchor here. Any joke, any quip, any song, send the editor, send
            the pundit, send the marketing executive, call them, write them, berate them,
            cajole them, to come here, because this is the story. This is the story
            and nothing else is, any more.
            <br><br>
            Because they are people.
            <br><br>
            And there is literally nothing in the world that matters more than that. -->
