Dear integral and influential member of this nation's media, 

I recently read some of your work describing Donald Trump, and his candidacy. Unfortunately, I believe you left out the single most important side of this man, and the one that deserves the lion's share of our national attention.

"They are not people. Just remember that."

Donald Trump said that, to a vast crowd, from a podium draped with his name, at a rally in North Carolina. Talking about people who were trying to address exactly this problem -- that he believes there is humanity that can be dismissed. That he can snarl away, while those around him nod soberly, encouraged, believing.

If there is one thing that makes me human, it is that I see other humans.

And I will not entertain the threat of a president who does not enshrine this principle. And I will not sit while he is written and talked and even joked about, in a way that allows one to ignore this side of him. But because I will still be here in America in November, and so will you, I plead with you now to use your post, and your profession, to describe the man as he is. 

Yours in the promise of civil society,
